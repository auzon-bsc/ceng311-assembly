NOTES:

In test file "ass2_mainFunction.asm" an argument for build was missing, so I added it.
Screenshots provided in zip file

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

	.global:
		tree variable and function labels because main function uses them
	.data:
		MAXINT := -9999 is loaded to register s7
		null := 'n' this represents null values
		tree # empty tree initialized here
		there are also some data for printing some text
	.text:
		build procedure:
			it uses a loop and iterates from the given list
			at each iteration a new value will be inserted
			when the value is equal to -9999 it terminates the loop
		insert procedure:
			it uses recursive calls to insert single element to tree
		find procedure:
			this procedure also uses recursive calls to find an element
		printTree:
			this is the longest and complex procedure
			first, it initialize some variables such as height of the tree
			then it begins to loop for iteration of each level
			there is also a small loop to print the empty nodes
			for non empty nodes, it uses recursive calls
		maxof:
			finds the biggest of the two numbers
		getheight:
			calculates the height of the tree
		printcontent:
			it is an auxilary procedure for printTree
			it prints at most two tokens
			first token is the node, second is a special formatted character
			special formatted characters: {'-', "    ", "\n"}
		
		all procedures composed of smaller procedures or labels to help the main one
